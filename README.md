# Reinforcement Learning book notes & exercises

## Introduction

This repo contains my notes on, and answers to exercises from, the book
*Reinforcement Learning* by Sutton and Barto (second edition).

The repo is organised as a collection of notebooks under the `notebooks`
directory.


## Getting started

To run the code in the notebooks, first install the `rl` package from
[here](https://github.com/Sen-R/reinforcement-learning) and the `dp`
package from [here](https://github.com/Sen-R/dynamic-programming).
